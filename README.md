# Circa
Circa allows users to create an account, then start tracking their energy levels throughout the day by letting users input data through an interactive graph. Over time, the graph would show what the user's daily energy levels look like on average at each hour. This would help the user know how their body works during different hours of the day, allowing them to productively do things.

This was made for Bitcamp 2025.
